# CSV_Keysight_decoder

`CSV_Keysight_decoder` is a small tool to decode and plot `CSV` files produced by Keisight VNA

## Prerequisites

You need matplotlib and numpy Python libraries to run `LSF_decoder`.

For example, on Ubuntu, this is the command line to install these libraries:

```bash
sudo apt-get install python python-matplotlib python-numpy
```

While the script is written in Python 3, it should be compatible with Python 2 (but it is unsupported and may become broken anytime).

## Equipment

To produce CSV files, you need a Keysight Vector Network Analyzers
